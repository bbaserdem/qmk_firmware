This file contains my [4x12 ortho](../../../default/ortho_4x12) board layouts
Check out the [user readme](../../../../users/bbaserdem/README.md) for more info.

# Planck

I use a couple [planck](../../../../keyboards/planck/readme.md) keyboards.

* Use the [light](../../../../keyboards/planck/light/readme.md) version.
* Use the [rev6](../../../../keyboards/planck/rev6/readme.md) version.

I have a daughter board that I'm trying to use for perkey leds.
Originally, in the firmware, the underglow rgb prints are configured both for
`RGBLIGHT` and `RGBMATRIX` code.
I differentiate between these two; and use;

* `RGBLIGHT` for underglow leds.
* `RGB_MATRIX` for the daughterboard, if I get to it at some point. (Doubtful)

Enable in rules.mk accordingly.

Will sell this though.
