# Gherkin

I use [Gherkin](../../../../keyboards/40percentclub/gherkin/readme.md) as a pad.

It is used as a game pad, and key layout is inspired by spare keys I had lying around.
The firmware is very simple, and only includes one layer keymap, and RGB effects.

## Status

* [x] Layout adapted
* [ ] Have not tested build yet
* [ ] Have not confirmed on board

Build command: `CFLAGS="-Wno-error=deprecated" TBF`
