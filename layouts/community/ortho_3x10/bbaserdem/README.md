# 3x10 Layout

Used with;

* [Gherkin](../../../../keyboards/40percentclub/gherkin/readme.md)

## Gherkin

It is used as a game pad, and key layout is inspired by spare keys I had lying around.
The firmware is very simple, and only includes one layer keymap, and RGB effects.
Last build command to do this was `make 40percentclub/gherkin:bbaserdem:flash`
