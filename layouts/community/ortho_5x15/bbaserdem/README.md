# XD75RE Setup
My keyboard for mainly office use.
I am not using this as often,
the planck feels way more compact.
Still maintaining the keyboard layout.

Builds fine as of 2019-12-17

# Make
Take the board into reset mode, then
```
make xd75:bbaserdem:flash
```
As suggested by the [faq](../../../../docs/faq_build.md),
implementing the correct udev rules to be able to flash without sudo.
