# Big Series PCB

Big switch that does tap dance, and works as a fancy light only.
The PCB was sourced from Woodkeys (Cole Markham) who scammed the community;
(me personally for 150$) so cannot recommend anyone try to obtain one.

Managed to obtain a custom glow in the dark keycap for this.

## Status
